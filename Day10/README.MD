🃏 What is Blackjack?
Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular and fast-paced card games in the casino world. The goal is simple: beat the dealer without going over 21.

🔑 Basic Rules:
Each player gets two cards.

Cards 2–10 are worth their face value.

Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10.

Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on what helps your hand.

Players can “Hit” (take another card) or “Stand” (keep their current hand).

If your total goes over 21, you bust and lose the round.

🏆 Winning:
You win if:

Your total is higher than the dealer’s (but still under or equal to 21).

The dealer busts.

You hit Blackjack — an Ace + a 10-value card on your first two cards.
